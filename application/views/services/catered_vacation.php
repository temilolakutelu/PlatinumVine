                        <p>
                            In 2006, Concierge Services, Inc. was created to raise the standard of service to residents of luxury properties throughout Greater Boston. Before establishing the company, Owner Greg Doyle himself worked as a concierge for a private residential community in Brookline, MA. While Greg believed service was adequate in terms of staffing, he felt service overall was dated and not reflective of how residents and guests live today, in a technologically advanced society. The market was in need of a company that incorporated technology into its operations
                            while staying true to the precepts of traditional hospitality service.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           Concierge Services, Inc. envisions service designed for the way residents live today, using technology to make life simpler, faster, and more efficient. Platinumvine soon debuted, and online concierge service began delivering a world of products and services hitherto unimagined of front desk service. In the process, Concierge Services, Inc. continues to re-shape our perception of the concierge while delivering to residents a level of service so unique that even hotels are calling us for guidance! For instance, concierge-catered vacations on Platinumvine transport residents from Boston to destinations throughout New England and beyond, including exotic destinations like St. Barth and Barbados in the Caribbean to Europe and Asia. Destinations are limited only by your imagination. Wherever you land, Concierge Services, Inc. and Platinumvine
                           welcome you with the same excellence in service you know back home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As Concierge Services, Inc.’s reputation for delivering quality service grew, so too did its business. Ownership soon reinvested the growth back into the company with land purchases in Barbados, West Indies and St. John, USVI as well as a beautiful, sixty-five acre estate in South Woodstock, Vermont. For Greg, re-imagining concierge service for how residents live today included owning resorts worldwide where residents could discover the excitement of the Platinumvine brand on their own. You see, the idea for concierge service involves so much more than processing packages and dry cleaning. It is about hospitality. So, too, is the resident more than just a person who resides within four walls. She is full of life and experiences. Concierge Services, Inc. is committed to delivering first class hospitality service through crafting experiences home and abroad for residents who expect more because they are more! We are here to add value to your life. Whether you are leaf-peeping in Vermont or sunbathing on the glimmering shores of Barbados with a rum punch in hand, Platinumvine will create an unforgettable experience crafted entirely for you. Whatever your destination, Platinumvine will indulge your wanderlust while
                             taking care of all the creature comforts that remind you of home.

                            With the exception of your dinner reservation, there is no need to pay separately each time.  For your convenience, charges are added to your on-Island Incidental Statement, inclusive of a 10% administrative fee. The Concierge will then arrange a time that is convenient to visit you at your villa.  The charges can be
                             settled by cash or credit card, and we accept Visa, Master Card or American Express.

                           Your Platinum Concierge travels the world near and far seeking
                           the beauty which inspires us all. Whether it is an unspoiled tropical beach that touches your heart or a hike by horseback through verdant tropical forests that exhilarates your soul, travel uplifts us all. St. John, Virgin Islands is a special place. Its natural resources are forever protected by the US National Park Services, at the behest of Lawrence Rockefeller, who donated thousands of acres of land to the US Government with the understanding that the land would never be developed. The promise has been kept. Pristine forests of verdant green, hemmed in only by golden sand beaches that count among the world’s finest,  give way only to the ebb and wane of
                            blue-green waters glistening under the sun. Join us for your adventure of  lifetime.

                         In 2016, Concierge Services, Inc. purchased a piece of paradise, high above Coral Bay on Bordeaux Mountain. For guests, we are building a luxurious villa and guest house with wellness spa, infinity pools and cascading waterfalls to cool and refresh you under the hot, tropical sun. As you swim hundreds of feet above the earth and beneath stars so close you can almost touch them, you will be delighted by the melodies of nature singing all around you. As darkness falls and goats and donkeys stop by to wish you good night, let the sounds of the ocean rhythmically lapping ashore beckon you further to slumber. And when it is time to turn in, open the windows and doors of your villa to the fresh mountain breeze all around you. As the sights and sounds of heaven envelope your senses while seated on your balcony, and the sky above turns from the familiar blue to exotic pinks famed by golden yellow hues, may count islands in the far off distance instead of sheep. Here on St. John,
                         you can be as creative as you like with nature. We don’t mind at all. Be our guest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                       Additionally, we partner with villa owners and managers throughout the island to make sure our inventory of options meets every wish imaginable. We have access to beach-front villas; townhomes and condominiums in Cruz Bay near bars and restaurants; private, executive estates in exclusive Peter Bay; and quaint rustic cottages on the East End, famous with the artist community. Wherever you stay, from mountain tops to valleys and everywhere in between, you will be pampered by the same high quality, custom service designed exclusively for you. For instance, Platinumvine can arrange charter tours—private and otherwise—to the US, Spanish, and British Virgin Islands aboard the finest yachts and Catamarans of all sizes and comfort levels. What’s more, because of our presence on the island and strong relationships with other vendors serving accomplished clientele like yourself, we can create bespoke experiences simply
                        unavailable to the general public, to create memories that will last a lifetime
                        </p>
                        <p>
                       While our focus on luxury and detail sets us apart, it is our commitment to direct communication with customers that matters most. Upon arrival, your on-island concierge will greet you and handle everything for you from luggage management to transporting you to your villa. Because we pair tradition with innovation, you can expect a pair of satellite messenger phones alongside the tropical umbrella drink waiting for you at your villa. We believe customized service means being able to reach your concierge wherever you are whether you are in the world. We understand internet connectivity may not be as flexible as we are, so we have gone one step further by elevating communication beyond the terrestrial by incorporating satellite communication into our operation. Rest assured, if you get a flat tire on the mountainside at 11pm we will be there to assist once we receive your communication.
                       We anticipate your needs so you do not have to. It is our pleasure to serve you.

                          Located on the banks of the Ottauquechee River and at the Crossroad of the Vermont Scenic Byway, this quaint New England town is tucked in the Green Mountains of Windsor County and is home to the only national park in Vermont and three historic covered bridges where
                           you can enjoy some of the most colorful seasons and activities in New England.

                             owned and operated by Concierge Services, Inc. Set amidst sixty-five
                             rolling acres of meadows, ponds and streams, Windsor Farm seems almost sunken,
                              as the Green Mountains rise around it in every direction giving guests the sense of being cradled by Mother Earth herself. We invite you to spend a long weekend with us—or however long you wish—enjoying fresh meals prepared especially for you by our on-site chef using ingredients from our very own farm. After lunch, take a stroll to the gazebo overlooking our two-acre pond where you may wish to take a dip in the mid-summer heat. Once summer finally welcomes Autumn, our horse-drawn carriages await to escort you through wood-covered bridges just down the country lane from our farm. You’ll enjoy the views of impeccably kept properties and lands along the way, while your olfactory senses are bedazzled by the mixture of burnt leaves and apple cider filling the crisp New England air. Do not worry. Heated blankets will accompany you on your little journey, and when you return home your concierge will be standing by, arranging activities from cheese and craft beer tasting sessions to maple syrup making in March. No trip to Vermont would be complete without mentioning ski country. The Vermont ski industry offers a range of services catering to ski aficionados of every level of expertise: Killington; Jay Peak; Smugglers Notch; Sugarbush Resort and of course Stowe, renown to many as the finest ski destination on the East Coast. You decide.
                             It is our pleasure to create the getaway of your creation. Be our Guest.
