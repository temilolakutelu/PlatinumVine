                                            Your Platinum Concierge travels the world near and far seeking
                                            the beauty which inspires us all. Whether it is an unspoiled tropical beach that touches your heart or a hike by horseback through verdant tropical forests that exhilarates your soul, travel uplifts us all. St. John, Virgin Islands is a special place. Its natural resources are forever protected by the US National Park Services, at the behest of Lawrence Rockefeller, who donated thousands of acres of land to the US Government with the understanding that the land would never be developed. The promise has been kept. Pristine forests of verdant green, hemmed in only by golden sand beaches that count among the world’s finest,  give way only to the ebb and wane of
                                                blue-green waters glistening under the sun. Join us for your adventure of  lifetime.

                                            In 2016, Concierge Services, Inc. purchased a piece of paradise, high above Coral Bay on Bordeaux Mountain. For guests, we are building a luxurious villa and guest house with wellness spa, infinity pools and cascading waterfalls to cool and refresh you under the hot, tropical sun. As you swim hundreds of feet above the earth and beneath stars so close you can almost touch them, you will be delighted by the melodies of nature singing all around you. As darkness falls and goats and donkeys stop by to wish you good night, let the sounds of the ocean rhythmically lapping ashore beckon you further to slumber. And when it is time to turn in, open the windows and doors of your villa to the fresh mountain breeze all around you. As the sights and sounds of heaven envelope your senses while seated on your balcony, and the sky above turns from the familiar blue to exotic pinks famed by golden yellow hues, may count islands in the far off distance instead of sheep. Here on St. John,
                                            you can be as creative as you like with nature. We don’t mind at all. Be our guest.

                                        Additionally, we partner with villa owners and managers throughout the island to make sure our inventory of options meets every wish imaginable. We have access to beach-front villas; townhomes and condominiums in Cruz Bay near bars and restaurants; private, executive estates in exclusive Peter Bay; and quaint rustic cottages on the East End, famous with the artist community. Wherever you stay, from mountain tops to valleys and everywhere in between, you will be pampered by the same high quality, custom service designed exclusively for you. For instance, Platinumvine can arrange charter tours—private and otherwise—to the US, Spanish, and British Virgin Islands aboard the finest yachts and Catamarans of all sizes and comfort levels. What’s more, because of our presence on the island and strong relationships with other vendors serving accomplished clientele like yourself, we can create bespoke experiences simply
                                            unavailable to the general public, to create memories that will last a lifetime

                                        While our focus on luxury and detail sets us apart, it is our commitment to direct communication with customers that matters most. Upon arrival, your on-island concierge will greet you and handle everything for you from luggage management to transporting you to your villa. Because we pair tradition with innovation, you can expect a pair of satellite messenger phones alongside the tropical umbrella drink waiting for you at your villa. We believe customized service means being able to reach your concierge wherever you are whether you are in the world. We understand internet connectivity may not be as flexible as we are, so we have gone one step further by elevating communication beyond the terrestrial by incorporating satellite communication into our operation. Rest assured, if you get a flat tire on the mountainside at 11pm we will be there to assist once we receive your communication.
                                        We anticipate your needs so you do not have to. It is our pleasure to serve you.
