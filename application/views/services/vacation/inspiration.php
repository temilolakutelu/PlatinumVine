                                        In 2006, Concierge Services, Inc. was created to raise the standard of service to residents of luxury properties throughout Greater Boston. Before establishing the company, Owner Greg Doyle himself worked as a concierge for a private residential community in Brookline, MA. While Greg believed service was adequate in terms of staffing, he felt service overall was dated and not reflective of how residents and guests live today, in a technologically advanced society. The market was in need of a company that incorporated technology into its operations
                                        while staying true to the precepts of traditional hospitality service.

                                    Concierge Services, Inc. envisions service designed for the way residents live today, using technology to make life simpler, faster, and more efficient. Platinumvine soon debuted, and online concierge service began delivering a world of products and services hitherto unimagined of front desk service. In the process, Concierge Services, Inc. continues to re-shape our perception of the concierge while delivering to residents a level of service so unique that even hotels are calling us for guidance! For instance, concierge-catered vacations on Platinumvine transport residents from Boston to destinations throughout New England and beyond, including exotic destinations like St. Barth and Barbados in the Caribbean to Europe and Asia. Destinations are limited only by your imagination. Wherever you land, Concierge Services, Inc. and Platinumvine
                                    welcome you with the same excellence in service you know back home.

                                        As Concierge Services, Inc.â€™s reputation for delivering quality service grew, so too did its business. Ownership soon reinvested the growth back into the company with land purchases in Barbados, West Indies and St. John, USVI as well as a beautiful, sixty-five acre estate in South Woodstock, Vermont. For Greg, re-imagining concierge service for how residents live today included owning resorts worldwide where residents could discover the excitement of the Platinumvine brand on their own. You see, the idea for concierge service involves so much more than processing packages and dry cleaning. It is about hospitality. So, too, is the resident more than just a person who resides within four walls. She is full of life and experiences. Concierge Services, Inc. is committed to delivering first class hospitality service through crafting experiences home and abroad for residents who expect more because they are more! We are here to add value to your life. Whether you are leaf-peeping in Vermont or sunbathing on the glimmering shores of Barbados with a rum punch in hand, Platinumvine will create an unforgettable experience crafted entirely for you. Whatever your destination, Platinumvine will indulge your wanderlust while
                                        taking care of all the creature comforts that remind you of home.
