                                            Your Resident Concierge’s duties are varied. He or she serves as a liaison between residents and management, for example, filing service requests, managing emergency-related service matters, and enforcing building policies and procedures to name just a few duties. Yet, the Concierge is also an Ambassador of Hospitality, arranging residents’ dry cleaning, dinner reservations, tickets to events, or simply providing them with directions to local attractions. Whether he is assisting emergency response personnel during a fire alarm or welcoming residents home, he is the first point of contact for the property you call home. Therefore, great care and consideration is given to the selection, training, and placement of staff. Knowledgeable yet self-effacing, trusted for professional expertise yet personably unassuming, concierges manage their responsibilities with grace and elan. They are friendly but never too friendly, greeting you warmly as you return home while
                                            reassuring clients and residents alike that they are in good hands.
