                                            It’s half past 11pm and your baby isn’t home.
                                        He has a curfew and knows to be home by 11pm. Where
                                        is he? What could have happened? Well, this scenario
                                        plays out across our country every night…until now!

                                            No more restless nights. We know where Fido is…canoodling with
                                            the French poodle across the street since 8:30pm! While we cannot guarantee that you’ll always be happy knowing your dog’s EXACT coordinates, we can honestly say that gps tracking for your pet is one cool idea!! Whether dropping your pet off at doggy daycare or setting him free to roam at home or abroad at any one of Concierge Services, Inc.’s concierge-catered destinations worldwide, you will
                                            have peace of mind knowing where your four-legged friend is at any moment’s notice.
