    In April, 2019 Greg Doyle, the Owner of Concierge Services, Inc. and Platinumvine, experienced firsthand the fear of the unknown when his English Bulldog, Churchill, became ill. Churchill’s jaw froze and he was suddenly unable to eat or drink water on his own. After initial tests came back inconclusive and only after additional consultation with the breeder, dog sitter and owner of the Veterinary Clinic where Churchill was seen did Greg find an explanation. Churchill was suffering from Trigeminal Neuritis, also known as drop-jaw, of unknown origin. For the next three weeks, Greg fed Churchill a special diet of oatmeal, scrambled eggs and burger meat to ensure proper weight management while feeding him water through a turkey baster until Churchill’s jaw muscles strengthened to the point he was able to eat and drink on his own. Yet, Churchill was not out of the woods even though the neuritis resolved by early May.

    <p>As Churchill regained mandibular strength, he lost bodily strength and his energy soon sapped almost completely. Blood work confirmed that Churchill was anemic, yet even X-rays and ultrasounds could not reveal the cause of this, either. The ultrasound did indicate that Churchill had a ‘bright’ liver, suggesting possible poisoning. However, Greg was surprised to learn that even with all of the tests available to Veterinary Clinicians, there were none that could definitively confirm whether or not Churchill had ingested anything poisonous. Thankfully, by early May Churchill rebounded and his health began to improve. As wonderful and welcome as this news was, the experience left Greg searching for answers to questions not only about what caused the health issues but also about the state of testing in general for our furry friends. For instance, wouldn’t it be wonderful to have a wealth of information at your disposal with just one swag of your pet’s cheek?

    While researching pet products and services online Greg felt residents would appreciate, he came across Embark. Embark is committed to learning everything there is to understand about the history of the domesticated dog including their relationship with humans. The result of this quest is DNA testing for dogs. According to the company, not only will DNA testing help illuminate the origins of certain canine diseases but they can also inform owners of behavioral patterns that will allow us to better understand our canine companions. How cool!

    <h5 class='text-center'>A Mission of Discovery</h5>
    <p>Powered by a deep love for dogs and a passion for understanding everything about them, Ryan and Adam Boyko have spent the last decade learning everything they could about dogs – how did they first get humans to fall in love with them, how did humans and dogs change each other in the years since then,
         and how can we best care for our furry family members?</p>
    
    <h5 class='text-center'>Scientific Vision</h5>
     <p>
                                            In the course of their quest to understand the domestic dog, Embark's founders have discovered many of the things that make every breed and every individual dog unique. Their pioneering work revealed an origin of the domestic dog near Central Asia over 15,000 years ago and the history of dog populations around the globe.

                                        <p>Adam's lab has also uncovered the genetic basis for many dog diseases and traits. While they have enjoyed working in remote corners of the world and in the lab, Adam and Ryan have always wanted to share their work and improve the lives of pet dogs everywhere. Partnering with the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, the leading veterinary school in the country, and Spencer Wells, a pioneer in consumer genetics, they founded Embark to bring cutting-edge science and insights directly onto your phone and desktop.</p>
                                        <p>Owners and their pets can immediately benefit from all the newest and most advanced science. They can also contribute to advancing scientific discoveries every day. By continually sharing new insights while collecting more data, our dogs can benefit from the best care.</p>
