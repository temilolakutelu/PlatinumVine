    <h5>Claremont Rug </h5>
    <p> Platinumvine is proud to recommend Claremont Rug-Antique Art Carpets, headquartered in Oakland, CA, for their exemplary knowledge of Persian and Oriental carpets supported by best-in-class services ranging from carpet cleaning to in-home consultation and design. Viewing rugs has never been easier, too. Claremont Rug displays their entire inventory on their website, so customers can choose exactly which rug they like best while learning about the product. Education is a key component to how Claremont does business. Jan David Winitz, President and Founder of Claremont Rug, explains the oriental rug market pyramid he created which breaks down modern and antique carpets into six categories based on artistry; craftsmanship; quality of material; condition;
         age and provenance. Learn more about the pyramid

    <p>Claremont Rug is fully attuned with how residents live today, and they understand the importance technology plays in simplifying your busy life. Yet, it is their commitment to service and the use of technology that distinguishes them from others in their field. While you can certainly learn a tremendous amount from one of their online courses designed to educate customers old and new, you can also expect this to be supported by traditional, old-fashioned service which earns your trust and respect. Jan has this to say about service and technology:</p>
    <p>“We live in a business world where, with ever more frequency, reports, surveys and polls conclude that customers are more demanding, expect quicker responses and, although they view technology as vital, they also sometimes experience it as an impediment to the quality of the service that they desire.”</p>
    <p>Intuitively, Jan understands that technology and service go hand in hand and not in replacement of one another. This is why Concierge Services, Inc. and Platinumvine feature Claremont Rug on the Vine. We are committed to delivering excellence in service through the use of technology as a means to the process and not as an end in itself. Because Claremont Rug understands this as well, they are able to meet your needs regardless of your location—or theirs. Physical addresses are but a starting point. Claremont Rug and clients meet in a variety of ways both virtually and in person. What remains constant is their commitment to full customer satisfaction; educating the consumer about the product and communicating with you in a fashion that works for you. The end point is always a fully satisfied, educated customer.
