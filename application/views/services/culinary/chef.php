                    <p> We do service some communities in South Eastern New Hampshire and on occasion will go to Southern Maine.
                    </p>
                    <p> Ask if we are available.... These are just a few of the communities we serve. If your town is near a listed community, we can accommodate you.
                        <br> Let us know... we would be happy to discuss your personal chef or in home catering needs.</p>
