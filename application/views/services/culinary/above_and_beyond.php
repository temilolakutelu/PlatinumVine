                                    <p>At Above and Beyond Catering, we are committed to providing affordable catering while never sacrificing quality of food or service. All meals are prepared in our kitchen daily using only the freshest ingredients available. We offer a wide selection of hors dâ€™ oeuvre, breakfast, lunch, and dinner options; however, we will always try to accommodate any special requests or dietary needs.</p><p> We request at least 48 hours notice, but understand when those last minute events come up. Please note that in such cases, menu options may be limited. Whether you are having a corporate meeting, wedding, church banquet, or a family reunion, each event is unique, so please contact us to design your individual menu. We will always strive to exceed your every expectation and are looking forward to working with you.</p>
