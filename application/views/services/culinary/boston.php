  <p>Real, Indian Chai. That is what two guys found missing in the Boston area. So, we set out to change that.
We are a Boston area, wholesome beverage start-up. Right now, our focus is two-fold: teaching people how to make chai and providing them the best ingredients to make it themselves. We are solving what we see as a problematic current state of Chai affairs in the US. Major chains have done our favorite beverage a disservice, so we want to appeal directly to the people and bring about a Chai-volution!
Chai is the combination of black tea leaves, masala or spices, water, milk, and ginger. We source our own black tea leaves from the fair- trade Amgoori Garden in Assam, India. Notably, owners of Amgoori respect the workers unlike other owners of tea gardens in Assam. Black, Assam tea is essential for Chai. Additionally, we grind our spices or masala every single week. Our masala consists of cinnamon, cardamom, fennel, cloves, dried ginger, star anise, and black pepper.
Chai is a simple drink that promotes coming together and conversing. We want to allow people to taste and experience chai for themselves, controlling all the ingredients and flavors that make it such a unique drink. Help us spread the word! Chaiâ€™s the limit!
