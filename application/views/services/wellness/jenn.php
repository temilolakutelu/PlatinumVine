                                    As a multimodal fitness expert, I work dynamically with my clients to tailor each workout to their unique needs, goals and often to their mood. Exercise should be dynamic, exciting and fun. Changing up your routine is the only way to keep your muscles guessing, and your mind engaged. I'm a Certified Master Fitness Trainer, Yoga & Pilates Instructor, and Holistic Health & Nutrition Coach. I specialize in healthy, manageable nutrition programming, Pre/Post Natal Fitness, Kettlebells, and keeping exercise fun! With my broad background and vast repertoire of effective and meaningful fitness routines
                                     I'll create a wellness program based on what you need, and what you genuinely enjoy.
