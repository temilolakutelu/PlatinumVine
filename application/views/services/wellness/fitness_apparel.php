                                           We believe that every woman should find comfort, confidence and style in their favorite pair of leggings.
                                            Boston is our home but our inspiration is drawn from the vibrant culture in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
                                             the birthplace of samba, sunshine, and every product we make. At Booty by Brabants, we’re here to
                                              break any rule that states leggings aren’t pants because they are, and ours are much more than that.
                                                We’ve created a built to last, one-size-fits-most clothing line that unites comfort and confidence
